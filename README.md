Muslim in AI

Muslim in AI (MAI) is a global initiative creating a space for sharing ideas, fostering collaborations, and discussing initiatives to increase the presence of Muslim individuals in the field of AI. To this end, we hold an annual technical workshop series, run mentoring programs, and maintain various fora for fostering partnerships and collaborations.

If you are in the field of AI and self-identify as a Muslim, please send your request to join along with a brief bio to ayshe.kok@gmail.com. Note, due to the volume of requests, there may be delays in processing your application.

We also welcome allies to join our group. Allies will be added to our email lists, where we send out group updates and requests for assistance.
